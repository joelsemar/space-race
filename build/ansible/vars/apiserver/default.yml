  # The celery docs have this to say: 
  #
  # More pool processes are usually better, but thereâ€™s a cut-off point where adding more pool processes 
  # affects performance in negative ways. There is even some encastence to support that having multiple worker
  # instances running, may perform better than having a single worker. 
  # For example 3 workers with 10 pool processes each. You need to experiment to find the numbers that works best for you,
  # as this varies based on application, work load, task run times and other factors.
